## Changes

### 1.0.0rc2 (unreleased)

- Rename the bale symbol sets from, e.g., *“Two-String Bales,
  39x18x15”* to *“Bales, Two-String, 39x18x15”*.  This makes Inkscape
  list them closer to the top of its list of symbol sets, thus
  minimizing the need to scroll.
  
#### Bugs

- Copy patterns into each bale symbol. This fixes the issue where the
  bale stipple patterns were not making it into the referencing
  documents.

- Fix vertical alignment of text in bale legends.
